I joined this college to become an engineer,  but by the end of 3rd year,  I became a looser. That's how good the college is. Let me break down the review to make things easy for you

Faculty: Worst faculty you can ever come across. Teachers - they might be good humans but absolutely pathetic in teaching. Once you sit in the lecture,  you will just wait for the lecture to end (imagine the student misery)

Infrastructure: Decent infrastructure but not worth the fees which is about 1.25 lakhs (2017 batch)

Students: Most of them are either through management quota or low scorers in MHTCET. So you can just imagine the kind of people you will spend your 4 years with.

Placements: Our TPO has absolutely no idea which company to approach for placements. In my batch,  majority of the companies the came were for tech support and some of the were even unregistered. TPO does try his best but due to poor quality of students,  companies avoid this college.

Final Verdict: I would suggest you to do Bcom instead than doing BE from this college as majority students come here for degree rather than education.","Like","13"

The atmosphere is kinda good from the outside, but it is completely the opposite when you go inside classrooms.
As far as I've seen the computers are little outdated.Good Teaching Staff, but management sucks, for basic documentation or requirements have to spend whole day, or have to revisit.","Like","6"

"213_Deepanshu Gupta","This collage takes lots of Xerox ek hi problem h..otherwise my collage is very best..
And also.. a big problem is they don't provide books to write assignments and pratical they we have to take pages every time..from the collage itself..which a little expensive too ..for 45 rupees we only get 50-55 pages  this number is not fixed too..sometimes 48 also..its a personal experience..and evry time we write something we have to take a printout of front page..it effects us lot..
And railway concession process is too slow the other colleges give concessions in an hour..but our college takes upto 10 days... isn't a big gap.. this is a second major problem. And fees is too high compare to other colleges on the same lane (Railwaywise)What i had experience.
Studies here is very good..
But these problems can't be hide from you..","Like","11"

"Dipesh Vinchhi","Good facility as an Exam Centre:
My child was allotted this as a centre for a competitive online exam. The facility for students was good as also for parents.
There is adequate parking for cars in the opposite building. And also on the road outside the institute.
Clean washrooms and waiting area for parents is also available. Overall a good exam centre.","Like","1"
